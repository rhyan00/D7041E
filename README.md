# Machine Learning Experiments: SVM and K-Means
This project demonstrates the application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Means clustering models on five datasets sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). The goal is to explore the performance of supervised and unsupervised learning models across diverse data structures and tasks.

## Datasets Used
1. **Abalone**  
2. **Balance Scale**  
3. **Breast Cancer**  
4. **Iris**  
5. **Wine**  

## Models Applied
1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
   - Used for supervised classification tasks.  
   - Evaluated using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.  
   - Performance varied based on dataset characteristics, with perfect scores achieved on Iris.

2. **K-Means Clustering**  
   - Used for unsupervised clustering tasks.  
   - Evaluated using metrics: Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index.  
   - Showed strong clustering performance on Iris and Balance Scale datasets.

## Summary of Work Done
- SVM was applied to classify labeled data and evaluate predictive accuracy.  
- K-Means was used to identify underlying patterns and optimal cluster counts in the datasets.  
- Results were compared to infer the strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases for each model.  

## Usage
This project demonstrates how machine learning models behave on structured and unstructured tasks.
